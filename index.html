        Here is a bit of information about me.</h2>

    <p class="introBody">I am an artistically driven Web Designer. I mean to say I like to make everything I make a work of art. So if the deadlines I'm given allow for the chance to make something I'm working on more beutifully functional then I'm likely to do that because it's just in my nature. Beauty in code to me is giving an element every functionality it could need while remaining clean cut and stream lined. If you need something that people would describe as "polished" then I might be your "right guy for the job". I've set up this website to help you get an intuitive idea of what I can do for you. So, if you like what you're reading check out my projects below.  </p>
